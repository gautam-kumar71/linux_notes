#introduction
**Good morning sir/madam,**  
My name is **Gautam Kumar**, and I’m currently pursuing a **B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**.

I have a good understanding of **problem-solving and data structures**, and I’ve solved many coding problems on platforms like **LeetCode, CodeChef, and CodeForces**.

Talking about my projects —  
One of my main projects is **ShopX**, an **e-commerce web app** built using the **MERN stack**. It allows users to browse products, add them to the cart, and make secure payments through **Stripe**. I was part of a **4-member team**, where each member had a defined role:
- One member of the team handled the designing part of the ui.
- Two other members of the team handled the frontend part. 
My main role was handling the **backend**, where I designed and implemented **RESTful APIs**, managed **user authentication**, and integrated the **payment system**.

Another project I worked on is TrailSnap, it is a **Real-Time Device Tracking Web App**, built with **Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO, Leaflet.js**, and the **Geolocation API**. It helps users **see live locations of multiple connected devices on a map**, updating in real-time.

One of my strengths is that I’m a **curious learner** — I love exploring topics that interest me and understanding them deeply. My weakness is that sometimes I go too deep into details that aren’t really needed, which can make me spend more time than necessary.

In my free time, I enjoy **playing Sudoku and Nonogram**, and I like spending time with my friends. These activities help me relax and refresh my mind.
